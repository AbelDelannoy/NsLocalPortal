## Technolgies && Usage

### Front

> npm
> bower

* Grunt :
 `grunt build` build the code : 
  1. compile less files to app/styles/main.css (+ map file in dev mode)
  2. build html files with JST (app/build/templates.js)
  3. build js files : requirejs optimisation, minify and uglify (app/buil/prod.js)

- `grunt release` : launch `grunt build` then change entry file in the index for production mode (prod.js)

- `grunt dev` : launch `grunt build` then change entry file in the index for development mode

 RequireJS
 Backbone Underscore
 MarionetteJs

- Rename the config.js.default to config.js then add your specifications (url of the REST server)
- If you setted a reverse proxy, don't forget to include "/portal-core/" in your URL-Rewrite part (example: http://127.0.0.1:6544/portal-core/{R:1})
- Don't forget to remove "bin" folders from hidden segments on IIS (Filtering demands -> Hidden sengments)

### Back

 >[Pyramid](http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/)
 >[SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)


You have to configure the [development.ini](https://github.com/NaturalSolutions/NsPortal/tree/master/Back/development.ini.default) which can be found in the [Back folder](https://github.com/NaturalSolutions/NsPortal/tree/master/Back/).
You have to enter the siteName parameter which the site name of the local site (### Site name).
Run `pserve development.ini` command in order to launch a Pyramid server.

If pserve fails because it doesn't find the development.ini file, try a `python setup.py develop` to avoid targeting the wrong egg.

If you want to avoid Numpy errors fired when launching the server, make sure you have no lib referencing it then restart the whole installation thing.
